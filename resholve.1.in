.Sh NAME
.Nm resholve
.Nd resolve external command/script references in shell scripts
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar options
.Ar script
.No ...
.Nm
.Op Ar options
<
.Ar script
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
replaces bare references (subject to a PATH search at runtime) to external
commands and scripts with absolute paths.
.Pp
This small super-power helps ensure script dependencies
are declared, present, and don't unexpectely shift when the PATH changes.
.Pp
.Nm
is developed to enable the Nix package manager to package and integrate
Shell projects, but its features are not Nix-specific and inevitably have other
applications.
.Sh REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

.Sh CONTROLLING RESOLUTION
If resholve can't figure something out, you can often help it along with a mix
of fake, fix, and keep
.Ar directives Ns
\&. \
If quoted, directives can be separated
by a space:
.Eo ' Ns Ar directive Ns [
.Ar directive ] Ns ... Ec Ns '
.Bl -tag -width 2n
.It Fl Fl fake Eo ' Ns Ar directives Ec Ns ' | Pf RESHOLVE_FAKE= Eo ' Ns Ar directives Ec Ns '
Pretend some things exist (if there's a good reason resholve doesn't know
about them). There is one directive form:
.Bl -tag -width 1n
.It Ar type : Ns Ar name Ns [; Ns Ar name ] Ns ...
Treat
.Ar name Ns (s)
of
.Ar type
as defined;
.Ar type
is the full word or first letter of:
.Ar a Ns lias,
.Ar b Ns uiltin,
.Ar e Ns xternal,
.Ar f Ns unction,
.Ar k Ns eyword,
or
.Ar s Ns ource.
.It Ex: Fl Fl fake No 'f:setUp;tearDown builtin:setopt source:/etc/bashrc'
.El
.It Fl Fl fix Eo ' Ns Ar directives Ec Ns ' | Pf RESHOLVE_FIX= Eo ' Ns Ar directives Ec Ns '
Fix some things it it isn't safe to fix/ignore by default. Directive forms:
.Bl -tag -width 1n
.It $ Ns Ar variable : Ns Ar command No (Note: $ may need escaping)
replace parameter expansions of
.No $ Ns Ar variable
with
.Ar command
.It Ar absolute_path
treat
.Ar absolute_path
as a bare reference that must be resolved
.It Cm aliases
resolve into alias definitions
.It Ex: Fl Fl fix No 'aliases $GIT:gix /bin/bash'
.El
.It Fl Fl keep Eo ' Ns Ar directives Ec Ns ' | Pf RESHOLVE_KEEP= Eo ' Ns Ar directives Ec Ns '
Ignore (omit errors for) some things it isn't safe to fix/ignore by default. Directive forms:
.Bl -tag -width 1n
.It Ar command : Ns $ Ns Ar variable Ns [; Ns $ Ns Ar variable ] Ns ... No (Note: $ may need escaping)
ignore
.No $ Ns Ar variable Ns (s)
in the arguments to
.Ar command
.It $ Ns Ar variable No (Note: $ may need escaping)
ignore
.No $ Ns Ar variable
or
.No ${ Ns Ar variable Ns No }
used as all or part of a first word (command)
.Pp
Such as: `$GIT status` or `$BUSYBOX/ls`
.It Ar absolute_path
ignore a specific
.Ar absolute_path
.It Ar ~/path
ignore a specific
.Ar home-relative_path
.It Ar ./path

.Sh NESTED RESOLUTION
Initially, resolution of commands in the arguments to command-executing commands was limited to one level for a hard-coded list of builtins and external commands. Version 0.6.0 (June 2021) adds recursive resolution.
.Pp
This task is complex. The main components of the current approach are:
.Bl -bullet
.It
To pick out a sub-command among other flags, options, and arguments,
.Nm
has a small collection per-command rules.
.Pp
This collection will need to grow, but I only intend to include fairly-common commands. I'm not sure yet if there will be a user-facing mechanism for customizing this; I'm not sure the current implementation is fully-baked, and I'd like to see how often it's needed. If you encounter instances of commands you think deserve explicit support, please report them.
.It
To meet the goal of blocking builds when all dependencies are not known,
.Nm
needs a way to discover command-executing executables that it lacks per-command rules for (a sub-command might be present, but it is unable to disambiguate).
.Pp
The discovery process is outsourced. Only the result--a directory of "lore"--is passed via the
.Fl Fl lore
flag or
.Ev RESHOLVE_LORE .
.Pp
.Nm
requires lore for every executable it finds in a script. \
See
.Sx Lore
for more on this format.
.El
.Pp
Nested resolution is much more rigorous--but (at least for now) it adds complexity that some users will need to wrestle with.
.Ss Lore
.Pp
Outsourcing discovery makes it easy to save/cache this lore and avoid repeating expensive work each run. \
It also makes it possible to hand-write or even generate it with tools that meet your own needs.
.Pp
Most users of the Nix API should be spared from needing to understand lore in detail. \
It automatically uses binlore (https://github.com/abathur/binlore) to generate lore for the executables in each input's bin/ directory, merge them into a combined copy, and pass it via RESHOLVE_LORE. \
If you find mis-identified executables, please report them to the binlore project.
.Pp
On the command-line, you can supply lore directly with two flags:
.Bl -tag -width x
.It Fl Fl execer Eo ' Ns Ar directives Ec Ns ' | Pf RESHOLVE_EXECER= Eo ' Ns Ar directives Ec Ns '
Each execer-lore directive indicates whether an executable sub-executes its arguments with a verdict:abspath pair, where verdict is one of can, cannot, or might. \
This information enables
.Nm
to raise an error when it encounters a command with a can|might verdict unless it has rules for figuring out whether the invocation includes a nested command.
.It Fl Fl wrapper Eo ' Ns Ar directives Ec Ns ' | Pf RESHOLVE_WRAPPER= Eo ' Ns Ar directives Ec Ns '
Each wrapper-lore directive indicates whether one executable is just an exec wrapper for another with a wrapper_abspath:wrapped_abspath pair. \
.Nm
uses this information to substitute the wrapped executable's verdict whenever it encounters a wrapper. \
(Executables are often wrapped in nixpkgs, but it's also common in packages. In gnugrep, for example, both egrep and fgrep are wrappers of grep.)
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
Most options can also be passed via environment variables. For example,
all of the following are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "RESHOLVE_KEEP" -compact
.\".It  RESHOLVE_FAFF
.It  RESHOLVE_INTERPRETER
.It  RESHOLVE_PATH
.It  RESHOLVE_INPUTS
.It  RESHOLVE_FAKE
.It  RESHOLVE_FIX
.It  RESHOLVE_KEEP
.It  RESHOLVE_LORE
.It  RESHOLVE_EXECER
.It  RESHOLVE_WRAPPER
.\".It  RESHOLVE_PRERESOLVED
.It  RESHOLVE_OVERWRITE
.\".It  RESHOLVE_LINT
.It  RESHOLVE_PROLOGUE
.It  RESHOLVE_EPILOGUE
.\" equivalent to --keep
.El
.\" .Sh FILES
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Pp
Error statuses are not yet systematic or stable (use them if they help you--but expect changes). Generally:
.Bl -tag -width "xx"
.It Sy 1
indicates a
.Pf non- Nm
error occurred (such as an error from the OSH parser)
.It Sy 2
indicates invocation/argument errors
.It Sy 3+
indicates a resolution error
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Basic invocations:
.Bd -literal
$ resholve --interpreter "$(which bash)" --path "$PATH" script.sh
$ resholve --interpreter "$(which bash)" --path "$PATH" < script.sh
$ resholve --interpreter "$(which bash)" --path "$PATH" script1.sh script2.sh
.Ed
.\" .Sh EXAMPLES
.\" .Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.\" For sections 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 printf/stderr messages only.
.Sh LIMITATIONS
.Nm
is built on the bash-compatible OSH parser (from the Oil shell
project). It can't handle any script OSH can't parse.
.Bl -bullet
.It
Support for non-bash shells is a happy side-effect of how similar POSIX-ish
shell languages are. If you run into a parse error with any non-bash syntax,
your only real option is changing the script.
.It
If you run into a parse error with valid bash syntax, check Oil's
issue tracker (https://github.com/oilshell/oil/issues)
to see if the issue
is known and whether it is likely to be fixed. If it won't be fixed, your only
recourse is changing the script.
